# customer-segmentation-clustering
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically Hierarchical and K-Means clustering. By analyzing a mall dataset containing customer income and spending scores, we aim to group customers into segments based on similar purchasing behavior and spending patterns. The project includes:

Dendrogram analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
K-Means clustering with the Elbow method for direct comparison.
Visualization of clusters to showcase different segmentation groups, highlighting behavioral patterns. This repository is ideal for anyone interested in clustering methodologies, customer segmentation, or understanding real-world applications of hierarchical and partitional clustering."
